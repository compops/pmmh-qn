# Correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings using quasi-Newton proposals
This code was downloaded from https://github.com/compops/pmmh-qn and contains the code and data used to produce the results in the papers:

J. Dahlin, A. Wills and B. Ninness, **Correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings using quasi-Newton proposals**. Pre-print, arXiv:1807:nnnnn, 2018.

The paper is available as a preprint from https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.nnnnn.

## Python code (python/)
This code is used to set-up and run all the experiments in the paper. The code can possibly also be modified for other models. See the `README.md` file for more information.

### Docker
A simple method to reproduce the results is to make use of the Docker container build from the code in this repository when the paper was published. Docker enables you to recreate the computational environment used to create the results in the paper. Hence, it automatically downloads the correct version of Python and all dependencies.

First, you need to download and installer Docker on your OS. Please see https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ for instructions on how to do this. Secondly, you can run the Docker container by running the command
``` bash
docker run -v <<LOCALPATH>>:/app/results -e EXPERIMENT='<<EXPERIMENT_NUMBER>>' -e FULLRUN='<<FULL_RUN>>' --name pmmh-qn-run compops/pmmh-qn:draft1
```
where `<<LOCALPATH>>` is replaced with a local path to where the results are to be stored, e.g., `/home/username/tmp` on a Linux computer. `<<EXPERIMENT_NUMBER>>` is replaced with either 1, 2 or 3 corresponding to the three experiments in the paper. `<<FULL_RUN>>` can be either 0 or 1. Selecting `0` runs only one experiment (for practical reasons) and `1` runs 5/10 Monte Carlo simulations just like in the paper.

Note that running with the flag `-e EXPERIMENT='1' -e FULLRUN='1'`, i.e. the first experiment (random effects model) and 5 Monte Carlo runs will probably take around a day to complete.

To reproduce the plots from the paper, move the contents of the results folder in `<<LOCALPATH>>` into a folder called results in a cloned version of the GitHub repository. Follow the instruction for the R code to create pdf versions of the plots. Note that the plot scripts are written for the case when `-e FULLRUN='1'` for the first and second example, which means that they might require some changes when running with `-e FULLRUN='0'`.

## R code (r/)
This code is used to generate diagnostic plot as well as plots and table for the paper. See the `README.md` file for more information.

## Binaries and results from simulations
The data generated from each run of the algorithm is rather large and cannot be easily distributed via GitHub. Please contact the authors if you would like to receive a copy of the output from the simulations. Otherwise, you should be able to reproduce all runs yourself within a few hours by running the Docker container.
