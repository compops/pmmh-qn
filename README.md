# Correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings using quasi-Newton proposals
This code was downloaded from https://github.com/compops/pmmh-qn and contains the code and data used to produce the results in the papers:

J. Dahlin, A. Wills and B. Ninness, Correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings using quasi-Newton proposals. Pre-print, arXiv:1807:nnnnn, 2018.

The paper is available as a preprint from https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.nnnnn.

## Python code (python/)
This code is used to set-up and run all the experiments in the paper. The code can possibly also be modified for other models. See the `README.md` file for more information.

## R code (r/)
This code is used to generate diagnostic plot as well as plots and table for the paper. See the `README.md` file for more information.

## Binaries and results from simulations
The data generated from each run of the algorithms is about 100 megabytes. Therefore the generated data cannot be easily distributed via GitHub. Please contact the authors if you would like to receive a copy of the out from the simulations. Otherwise, you should be able to reproduce all runs yourself within a few hours by running the Docker container.
